  <p>PLATE I.&mdash;THE ANSIDEI MADONNA. Frontispiece</p>

  <p>(In the National Gallery, London)</p>

<p class="block">Better than any other picture by Raphael, this important altar-piece
shows the precociousness of Raphael's genius, for it was
painted at Perugia in 1506, when the master had scarcely passed
into the twenty-third year of his life. He had then just returned
from Florence, but, probably to humour his patrons, the Ansidei
family, he reverted in this picture once again to the formal manner
of his second master, Perugino. The "Ansidei Madonna" has the
distinction of being the most costly picture at the National Gallery&mdash;it
was purchased in 1885 from the Duke of Marlborough for
£70,000.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="I" id="I">I</a></h2>

<p>"And I tell you that to paint one beautiful
woman, I should need to see
several beautiful women, and to have
you with me to choose the best," wrote
Raphael, then at the zenith of his fame
and good fortune, to his life-long friend
Count Baldassare Castiglione, who&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
ideal courtier himself&mdash;has given the world
that immortal monument of Renaissance
culture, the Book of the Courtier. In penning
these lines the prince of painters
intended, perhaps, no more than a pretty
compliment to one who was himself a
model of courtesy and graceful speech,
but the words would gain deep significance
if <i>picture</i> were substituted for <i>woman</i>,
and if Castiglione were taken to signify
the personification of intellect and learning.
For the beauty of Raphael's art, which in
the course of four centuries has lost none
of its hold upon the admiration of mankind,
is distilled from the various elements of
beauty contained in the art that had gone
before him and was being created around
him; and in choosing the best, at least as
far as idea and conception are concerned,
he was guided by the deepest thinkers and
keenest intellects of what were then the
world's greatest centres of culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>Raphael was, indeed, born under a
happy constellation. He was not a giant
of intellect, nor an epoch-making genius;
as Michelangelo said of him, he owed his
art less to nature than to study; but he
was born at a time when two centuries
of gradual artistic development had led
up to a point where an artist was needed
to gather up the diverging threads and
bring the movement to a culmination, which
will stand for all times as a standard of
perfection. Advantages of birth and early
surroundings, charm of appearance and
disposition which made him a favourite
wherever he went, receptivity, adaptability,
and application, and above all an early and
easy mastery of technique, were combined
in Raphael to lead him to this achievement.
The smooth unclouded progress of his life
from recognition to fame, from prosperity
to affluence, is not the turbulent way of
genius. Genius walks a sad and lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
path. Michelangelo, the turbulent spirit,
morose and dissatisfied, Lionardo da Vinci,
pursuing his high ideals without a thought
of worldly success until his lonely old age
sees him expatriated and contemplating the
fruitlessness of all his labours&mdash;these men
of purest genius have little in common with
the pliant courtier Raphael, the head himself
of a little court of faithful followers.
The story goes that Michelangelo, in the
bitterness of his spirit, when meeting his
happy rival at the head of his usual army
of some fifty dependants on his way to the
Papal court, addressed him with the words
"You walk like the sheriff with his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse
comitatus</i>." And Raphael, quick at repartee,
retorted "And you, like an executioner
going to the scaffold." Whether the
anecdote be true or not, it marks the difference
between the course of talent&mdash;albeit
the rarest talent&mdash;and that of genius.</p>

  <p>PLATE II.&mdash;THE MADONNA DEL GRAN DUCA</p>

  <p>(In the Pitti Palace, Florence)</p>

<p class="block">This picture, remarkable for the effective simplicity of its design
and for the purity of the Virgin's face, derives the name by which
it is commonly known from the fact that it was bought in 1799 by
the Grand Duke Ferdinand III. from a poor widow, and held by
him in such esteem that he would never part from it and always
took it with him on his travels. At one time it was actually
credited with the power of working miracles. It is one of the first
works of Raphael's Florentine period, and now hangs in the Pitti
Palace, Florence.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>What are the qualities of Raphael's art
that have carried his fame unsullied through
the ages and made him the most popular,
the most admired, of all painters? The
greatest of the primitives, and of the later
masters Velazquez, Rembrandt, Frans Hals,
Watteau, to mention only a few of the
brightest beacons in the realm of art, have
at some time or other been eclipsed and
held in slight esteem. Raphael alone
escaped the inconstancy of popular favour;
he was set up as an idol before he left the
world to mourn his untimely death, and in
the course of the years the world's idolatrous
worship was extended even to the
feeble handiwork of his assistants, which
often passed under his name. Only within
the memory of living men did this blind
and indiscriminating worship lead to a reaction
as indiscriminating. But this reaction
was confined to a comparatively
small circle of æsthetically inclined art
enthusiasts; and to-day, when the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
scientific methods of criticism have succeeded
in sifting the wheat from the chaff&mdash;the
master's own work from the factory-like
production of his bottega&mdash;he has been
reinstated in all his former glory. Contemptuous
hostility to Raphael's art has
ceased to be a fashionable pose. The
frank acknowledgment of the perfection of
this art is no longer stayed by the consciousness
of the harm done by that imperfect
imitation of the Raphaelic code of
beauty, which has been the result of all
academic teaching in Europe since the
founding of the Prix de Rome.</p>

<p>Beauty, formal beauty, pure and faultless,
must appeal to everybody; and Raphael
means to us the perfection of beauty&mdash;such
beauty as lies in rhythm, balance, colour,
form, and execution. It is a calculated
beauty, the lucid, unambiguous expression
of an absolutely normal, well-balanced mind
assisted by an unerring hand; hence it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
intelligible to everybody without that unconscious
mental effort which is needed for the
understanding of an art of greater emotional
intensity. It is of the very essence of art
that it should express an emotion; a picture
which is merely imitative without holding
a hint of what the artist felt at the time
of creating it, ceases to be a work of art,
even if it represents a subject beautiful in
itself. On the other hand, an ugly subject
may be raised to sublime art by emotional
statement; but this emotion is of necessity
more complex and more difficult to understand
than that simplest of all emotions,
the pleasure caused by the contemplation
of beauty. This accounts for the common
fallacy that art and beauty are indissolubly
connected, and for the favouritism shown by
all the successive generations to Raphael
whose brush was wedded to beauty in the
classic sense, and whose art knew nothing
of the beauty of character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>But beauty alone does not constitute
Raphael's greatness, or Bouguereau and many
other modern academic painters would have
to be accounted great instead of being
merely dull and insipid. Raphael developed
to its utmost power of expressiveness the
art of space-composition, the secret of which
was the heritage of the Umbrian painters.
What space-composition means cannot be
better defined than it has been by Mr.
Berenson: "Space-composition differs from
ordinary composition in the first place most
obviously in that it is not an arrangement
to be judged as extending only laterally, or
up and down on a flat surface, but as extending
inwards in depth as well. It is
composition in three dimensions, and not
in two, in the cube, not merely on the surface&hellip;.
Painted space-composition opens
out the space it frames in, puts boundaries
only ideal to the roof of heaven. All that
it uses, whether the forms of the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
landscape, or of grand architecture, or even
of the human figure, it reduces to be its
ministrants in conveying a sense of untrammelled,
but not chaotic spaciousness. In
such pictures, how freely one breathes&mdash;as
if a load had just been lifted from one's
breast; how refreshed, how noble, how
potent one feels; again, how soothed; and
still again, how wafted forth to abodes of
far-away bliss!"</p>

<p>This sense of space and depth is achieved
by methods which have nothing in common
with our modern art of creating the illusion
of what is called "atmosphere"&mdash;not by
the "losing and finding" of contours, not
by the application of optical theories, such
as the zone of interchanging rays which dissolves
all hard outlines, nor by the blurring
and fogging of the distance. Space-composition
in the sense in which it was practised
by Raphael is closely akin to the art of
architecture in its appeal to our emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>As an illustrator, again, Raphael was unequalled
as regards clear, direct, measured
statement of all that is essential to the
immediate grasping of the idea or incident
depicted. The first glance at one of
Raphael's works, whether it be a small
panel picture or a monumental fresco, reveals
its whole purport, and that in a
manner so complete and lucid and convincing
as could not be achieved by any other
method of expression. With infallible sureness
he invariably found the shortest way
for the harmonious statement of idea, form,
and emotion, which in his work are always
found in perfect balance and so completely
permeated by each other as to constitute
an indissoluble trinity.</p>

<p>Another reason for Raphael's powerful
appeal&mdash;and in this he is perhaps the most
typical child of his period&mdash;is that his art
unites in one majestic current the two
greatest movements of thought which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
ever fired the imagination of civilised
Europe; classic antiquity and Christian
faith, when treated by Raphael's brush,
cease to be incompatible and live side by
side in that measured harmony which is the
hall-mark of his art. Christianity is presented
to us in the glorious classic garb of
the old world, and the myth and philosophy
of the ancients are brought into intimate
relationship with Christian teaching.
He infuses new blood and life into the
stones of ancient Greece and Rome&mdash;unlike
Mantegna who had remained cold and
classic in his relief-like reconstructions of
antiquity; just as he accentuates the
human emotional side of the Madonna and
Child <i>motif</i> by discarding all hieroglyphic
symbolism and setting before our eyes the
intimate link of love that connects mother
and babe. Almost imperceptibly his cupids
are transformed into child angels, and the
Jehovah of his "Vision of Ezekiel" has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
more in common with Olympian Jove than
with the mediæval conception of the Lord
of Heaven.</p>

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE III.&mdash;THE MADONNA DELLA SEDIA</p>

  <p>(In the Pitti Palace, Florence)</p>

<p class="block">The Madonna "of the Chair," one of the most characteristic
and deservedly popular of Raphael's numerous versions of the
Virgin and Child <i>motif</i>, belongs to the master's full maturity, and
was painted during his sojourn in Rome, at the time when he was
occupied with the stupendous task of decorating the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</i> of the
Vatican. It would be difficult to find in the whole history of art
a more pleasing solution of the problem presented by a figure composition
in the round. The picture is now in the Pitti Palace,
Florence.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Just as Timoteo Viti, Perugino, Fra
Bartolommeo, Lionardo da Vinci, Masaccio,
Michelangelo, and Sebastiano del Piombo
(who imparted to him something of the
glow of Venetian colouring), had been the
sources from which Raphael drew his
knowledge of technique, colour, composition,
and all the elements of pictorial style,
so the humanists had paved his way as regards
the intellectual aspect of his art.
His marvellous faculty of rapid assimilation
enabled him, on the one hand, to
appropriate whatever he found worthy of
imitation in his precursors and contemporaries,
and thus to complete his technical
equipment at an age at which it was
given to few to have achieved mastery;
whilst, on the other hand, his clear intellect,
aided by the not entirely unmercenary
desire to please his patrons, helped
him to carry out with triumphant success
the ideas evolved by the keenest thinkers
of his time. To doubt that the general
idea, and perhaps a good many of the
details, of such a stupendous work as the
fresco decoration of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</i> at the Vatican,
had originated in Raphael's head, is
not to detract from his greatness. He was
a boy in his early teens when he entered
his first master's bottega. He was a youth
of twenty-five when he started on his great
task; and the intervening years had been
so completely filled with the study of his
craft and with the execution of important
commissions, that it is impossible to believe
he could have found much leisure for
book-learning. And such learning was indispensable
for the conception of that elaborate
scheme with all its historical allusions
and allegorical imagery. The wonder is
that Raphael could so completely enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
into the suggestions made to him from
various sources, and to weave them into a
tissue of immortal beauty.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h2>


<p>At the end of the fifteenth century the
rule of the Duke Federigo of Montefeltre,
an enlightened prince who devoted the best
of his energy and such time as he could
spare from his duties on the battlefield to
the patronage of the arts, to the adornment
of his noble palace, and to the collecting
of priceless manuscripts, paintings, antiques,
and works of art of every description, had
raised the old city of Urbino to one of the
centres of culture and learning, and made
the ducal court a gathering-place for the
distinguished painters, architects, poets,
and humanists who were attracted by the
wealth and liberality of this great patron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Among the less distinguished satellites attracted
by the sun of Montefeltre was one
Giovanni Santi, who had come to Urbino
in the middle of the fifteenth century.
Though a painter of considerable skill,
trained perhaps by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo,
he found it necessary in the early days of
his sojourn at Urbino to supplement his
modest income by trading in oil and corn
and other commodities, as his father had
done before him. But his varied accomplishments
soon brought him into prominence
and secured him a position as court
painter and poet. More important than
any of the pictures that have come to us
from his brush is his famous rhyming
chronicle of 23,000 verses in Dantesque
measure, in which he glorifies the virtues
and exploits of his patron. He was a special
favourite of Elisabetta Gonzaga, the youthful
spouse of Federigo's son Guidobaldo, whose
high esteem for Giovanni is expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
a letter in which she informs her sister-in-law
of the court painter's death.</p>

<p>To this Giovanni Santi and to his wife
Magia Ciarla was born on Good Friday,
the 28th of March<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> 1483, a son who was
destined in the comparatively short span
of his life to rise to fame such as has been
the share of few mortals. An elder brother
and sister of Raphael had died in infancy,
and his mother followed them to the grave
before he had reached his eighth year. Her
place in the paternal home was taken by
Bernardina Parte, a goldsmith's daughter,
whom Giovanni wedded soon after his first
wife's death. From Giovanni Santi's great
poem it would appear that he was on terms
of friendship and intimacy with some of
the greatest masters of the time, such as
Melozzo da Forli, Mantegna, Pier dei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Franceschi, and Verrocchio; and it is
reasonable to assume that Raphael's earliest
art education under his father's guidance
tended towards the development of that
peculiar faculty which enabled him later on
to seize and assimilate the excellences in
the style of the various masters with whom
he came in contact.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a> The wording of Raphael's epitaph, which states that he died on
the same day (of the year) on which he was born, has led some writers
to the assumption that he was born on April 6, whereas it is merely
meant to signify that he was born and died on Good Friday.</p>

<p>The ease with which his precocious talent
absorbed the teaching of his masters became
evident when, soon after his father's death,
in 1494, from fever contracted in the malarial
air of the Mantuan marshland, whither he
had gone in the service of Elisabetta
Gonzaga, he entered the bottega of Francia's
pupil Timoteo Viti (or della Vite), who
settled at Urbino in 1495, and whose eminent
position among the painters of that city
must have suggested to Raphael's guardian&mdash;his
maternal uncle Simone Ciarla&mdash;the desirability
of placing the youth under such
competent tuition. And so thoroughly did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Raphael acquire not only his first master's
style, but even such of his mannerisms as
the broad shape of hands and feet and the
languid turn of the heads, that from such
internal evidence Morelli, the originator of
the modern method of criticism, was able
after more than three centuries of error to
disprove Vasari's assertion that Raphael
passed straight from his father's workshop
into that of Perugino. Timoteo's influence
is apparent even in works painted by
Raphael at a time when he had come under
the spell of the more powerful personality
of Perugino, like the "Sposalizio" or "Betrothal
of the Virgin," of 1504, in the Brera
Gallery in Milan; but it is unmistakably in
evidence in the three earliest pictures that
bear Raphael's name: the "Vision of a
Knight," at the National Gallery, the "St.
Michael," at the Louvre, and the "Three
Graces," at Chantilly. Not only the features
which connect this group of pictures with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the style of Timoteo Viti, but the timid
meticulous execution and the naïve stiffness
of the figures, mark them as works of
Raphael's immature youth. The turn of
the century, as we shall see, found Raphael
at Perugia, so that the three pictures mentioned
must have been painted before he
had attained the age of seventeen. The
panel of the "Three Graces," which, by the
way, was obviously inspired by an antique
cameo, was bought in 1885 by the Duc
d'Aumale from Lord Dudley's collection for
£25,000&mdash;surely a price without parallel for
a work painted by a lad of sixteen! A portrait
in chalk of the marvellously gifted,
winsome boy by the hand of his first master
is preserved at the University Galleries in
Oxford.</p>

<p>The records of a lawsuit between some
members of his family prove that Raphael
was still at Urbino in 1499, since in the
summer of this year he appeared as a witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
in court. When the verdict was given in
the following year, he had already left for
Perugia to continue his studies as an
assistant of Perugino. Again we find him
before long assimilating the style of his new
master so successfully and completely that,
to use Vasari's words, "His copies cannot be
distinguished from the original works of
the master, nor can the difference between
the performances of Raphael and those of
Pietro be discerned with any certainty."
Plagiarism in those days did not trouble
the artistic conscience, and it is easy to
trace in Raphael's pictures of that period
entire groups that are borrowed from the
elder master. Thus the "Crucifixion," painted
about 1501 for a church in Città di Castello,
and now in the collection of Dr. Ludwig
Mond, is obviously based on Perugino's
version of the same subject at St. Augustine's,
Siena, whilst the whole upper part
of the Vatican "Coronation of the Virgin"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>is "lifted" from an "Assumption" by Pietro.
But this almost literal imitation was only
a passing phase, whilst the great lesson
of space-composition and the typically
Umbrian gift of almost religious fervour in
stating the peaceful glory of the Umbrian
hill-land, which had been imparted to
Raphael at Perugia, remained permanent
acquisitions to his art.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 262px;">

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE IV.&mdash;LA BELLE JARDINIÈRE</p>

  <p>(In the Louvre)</p>

<p class="block">"La Belle Jardinière" is a magnificent example of Raphael's
Florentine style, which came from his being influenced by Leonardo
da Vinci when at Florence (see the triangular composition). The
Virgin's mantle was probably finished by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio;
other parts&mdash;the hands and the feet&mdash;are hardly finished; nevertheless
it is one of the finest, most expressive, and touching Madonnas
by the Master.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In 1502 Perugino went back to Florence,
and Raphael probably joined Pinturicchio's
staff of assistants, though Vasari's statement
that he furnished the designs for the latter
master's frescoes in the Piccolomini Library
at Siena may be dismissed as a fable.
During this time Raphael painted his first
Madonna pictures, notably the "Conestabile
Madonna" (now at St. Petersburg), which is
based entirely on Perugino's "Virgin with the
Pomegranate," and two panels at the Berlin
Museum. The Milan "Sposalizio," in which
the young master's personality already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
asserts itself through the very marked
Ferrarese and Peruginesque influences, was
painted in 1504 for the church of St. Francesco
at Città di Castello. His early mastery
in portraiture is illustrated by his portrait of
Perugino at the Borghese Gallery, which is
so firm in character and perfect in execution
that it could pass for many years as the
handiwork of Holbein.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Duke Guidobaldo had returned
to Urbino after the death of his enemy, Pope
Alexander VI., and thither Raphael proceeded
in 1504. The little "St. George" at the
Louvre is a memento of this short visit which
terminated in October of the same year,
when Raphael, armed with a letter of warmest
recommendation from Guidobaldo's sister
Giovanna della Rovere to the Gonfaloniere
Pier Soderini, left his native town for
Florence, then the centre of artistic life,
astir with the rivalry between the giants
Michelangelo and Lionardo da Vinci.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>The young man must have been fairly
bewildered at the multitude of new impressions
that crowded upon him in the glorious
city on the banks of the Arno, with its imposing
palaces and churches, its seething life
and its art so much more virile and monumental
than the dreamy, almost effeminate
art engendered by the soft balmy atmosphere
of Umbria. How he must have revelled
in the contemplation of Masaccio's
noble frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel&mdash;the
training school of generations of painters&mdash;which
ten years later were echoed in his
tapestry cartoons for the Sistine Chapel!
How he must have stood in wonder and
amazement before Michelangelo's "David,"
and have resolved forthwith to devote himself
to a more intimate study of the human
form and movement! The fascination exercised
upon him by the genius of Lionardo
found expression in some of the earliest
fruits of Raphael's sojourn in Florence&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
portraits at the Pitti Palace known as
"Angelo Doni" and his wife Maddalena
Strozzi, who, however, could not possibly
have been the model for this reminiscence of
Lionardo's "Mona Lisa," since it is known
that she was baptized in 1489, whereas
Raphael's portrait of 1504 represents a
woman of ripe age.</p>

<p>In the workshop of the architect Baccio
d'Agnolo, which was then a favourite social
resort of the younger artists of Florence, the
youth from Urbino met on terms of equality
such masters as Ridolfo Ghirlandajo, Antonio
da Sangallo, Sansovino, and Fra Bartolommeo,
who again had a considerable share in
the formation of Raphael's style, as may be
seen from the "Madonna di Sant'Antonio,"
now lent to the National Gallery by Mr.
Pierpont Morgan who is said to have paid
for it the enormous price of £100,000. This
picture, and the "Ansidei Madonna," which
was bought for the National Gallery from
the Duke of Marlborough's collection for
£70,000, were painted during a visit to
Perugia towards the end of 1505&mdash;the former
for the nuns of St. Antony of Padua, in
Perugia, and the other for the Ansidei Chapel
in the church of San Fiorenzo of the same city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE V.&mdash;THE MADONNA OF THE TOWER</p>

  <p>(In the National Gallery, London)</p>

<p class="block">This beautiful painting, which the National Gallery owes to the
generosity of Miss Eva Mackintosh, who presented it to the nation
in 1906, was at one time in the collection of the Duc d'Orléans.
The late owner was fortunate in securing this unquestionably
genuine masterpiece at the Rogers' sale in 1856 for 480 guineas.
It was painted about 1512; and a copy of it by Sassoferrato is in
the Leichtenburg collection in St. Petersburg.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The records of Raphael's movements between
1504 and 1508, when he finally left
Florence, are scanty and unreliable. Certain
it is that, besides his visit to Perugia, he
spent some time at Urbino in 1506, when
he painted for Guidobaldo the "St. George"
which figured among the gifts taken by
Castiglione to Henry VII. of England, from
whom the Duke of Urbino had received the
insignia of the Garter two years previously.
The picture is now at the Hermitage in
St. Petersburg. The majority of those
exquisite Madonna pictures, which have
contributed more than anything else to
Raphael's undying fame and popularity, date
from his Florentine period&mdash;the "Madonna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
del Granduca" at the Pitti Palace, the
"Casa Tempi Madonna" at Munich, the
Chantilly "Madonna of the House of Orleans,"
the "Madonna of the Meadow" in
Vienna, the "Madonna of the Goldfinch"
at the Uffizi, the "Madonna of the Lamb"
at Madrid, Lord Cowper's famous picture at
Panshanger, and the "Belle Jardinière" at
the Louvre.</p>

<p>To the same period belongs the portrait
of himself, in the Painter's Hall of the Uffizi,
and the portrait of a youth in the Budapest
National Gallery. On the occasion of his
visit to Perugia, Atalanta Baglione, the
mother of Grifonetto Baglione who had
fallen a victim to the bloody family feud
that turned Perugia into a slaughter-house
in 1500, commissioned from Raphael an
altar-piece in memory of that event&mdash;the
"Entombment" which the master finished
in Florence in 1507, and which is now at
the Borghese Gallery. It was Raphael's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
first attempt at dramatic composition, the
art of which he had yet to master&mdash;its
forced, unnatural emotion lays it more
open to criticism than any other work from
his own hand.</p>

<p>A law-case in connection with the payment
of 100 crowns due by him for a house
he had purchased from the Cervasi family,
necessitated Raphael's presence at Urbino
once again in October 1507. In April of
the following year Guidobaldo died; and a
letter from Raphael to his uncle Simone
Ciarla, who had informed him of this sad
event, proves that the master was then
back again in Florence. After expressing
his grief at the news of the Duke's death
("I could not read your letter without
tears"), Raphael appeals in this letter to
his uncle to procure him another letter of
recommendation to the Gonfaloniere of
Florence "from my Lord the Prefect," since
it was in the power of the chief magistrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of Florence to place an important
commission for the decoration of a certain
apartment.</p>

<p>But a better fate was in store for the
youthful applicant, who was to be called
to a wider field of action. According to
Vasari it was Raphael's kinsman, Bramante
of Urbino, who drew Pope Julius II.'s attention
to the rare gifts of Raphael, and caused
him to be summoned to Rome. And the
voice of Bramante, who stood in high favour
with the Pope, and was engaged on the
scheme of rebuilding the Cathedral of St.
Peter, would certainly have commanded
attention. But on this, as on many other
points, Vasari is not wholly trustworthy.
First of all, Bramante was not connected
with Raphael by any family ties; and, then,
it is far more probable that the thought
of calling Raphael to Rome to assist in
the decoration of the papal apartments in
the Vatican was suggested to Julius II.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
by the Prefetessa Giovanna della Rovere,
who had always been a staunch supporter
of the Urbinate, or by her son Francesco,
the nephew and successor of Duke Guidobaldo
Montefeltre. Bramante, who was on
terms of friendship with his fellow-artist and
fellow-townsman, may well have supported
the recommendation. However this may
be, Raphael received the Pope's command,
and journeyed to Rome, whither he had
already been preceded by Michelangelo.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h2>


<p>Raphael came to Rome before September
1508, for on the 5th of that month he
sent a letter from the city of the popes to
Francia at Bologna, whom he had probably
met at Urbino. It must have been
an intoxicating experience for the young
master to find himself suddenly surrounded
by the wonders of the classic world which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
at that time dominated the whole world of
thought so that Christianity itself became
permeated with Paganism; and to be as
suddenly raised from the modest position,
which in Florence had made him look with
awe and veneration upon Michelangelo and
Lionardo, to independent responsibility, as
the compeer of the greatest of his calling.
From the very first Pope Julius II. seems
to have placed the utmost confidence in
the newcomer, and the manner in which
Raphael accomplished the first task set to
him by his mighty patron not only justified
this confidence but apparently made the
Pope dissatisfied with much of the decorative
work that had been executed in
the Vatican rooms before the advent of the
Urbinate.</p>

<p>Julius II.'s hatred of his predecessor,
Alexander VI., had made it distasteful for
him to live in the apartments that had been
occupied by the Borgia Pope, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
decided, in 1507, to move into the upper
rooms of the Vatican, which, under the pontificate
of Nicholas V., had been decorated
by Pier dei Franceschi and Bramantino.
These frescoes, however, did not find favour
with the new Pope, who enlisted the services
of Perugino, Peruzzi, Sodoma, Signorelli,
and Pinturicchio for the redecoration of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</i>, and finally entrusted Raphael
with the painting of four medallions in
Sodoma's ceiling in the first room, the
Camera della Signatura. There has been
some divergence of opinion as to the use
of this room, but the subjects of the decorative
scheme clearly point towards its being
originally intended for a library. The
allegorical figures of Theology, Philosophy,
Jurisprudence, and Poetry with which
Raphael filled the four medallions of the
vaulted ceiling, were often used for the
decoration of libraries during the late Renaissance;
and the frequent occurrence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
books in all the compositions lends further
probability to this theory.</p>

<p>So delighted was Julius II. with the
manner in which Raphael had acquitted
himself of his first commission, that he,
forthwith, charged him with the decoration
of the entire suite of four rooms, and ruthlessly
decreed the destruction of all the
fresco-work previously done by other hands.
But Raphael, in his hour of victory, gave
proof of that generous and amiable disposition
which endeared him to all with whom
he came in contact. He prevailed upon his
impetuous employer to save some of the
work of Baldassare Peruzzi and of Perugino,
and Sodoma's ceiling decoration in the
Camera della Signatura. A series of heads
by Bramantino, "so beautiful and so perfectly
executed, that the power of speech
alone was required to give them life," had
to go, but before their destruction Raphael
had them copied by one of his assistants.
After his death these copies were presented
by Giulio Romano to Paolo Giovio, and it is
more than probable that they are identical
with the "Bramantino" portraits from the
Willett collection, now at the Metropolitan
Museum, New York, and at South Kensington.
Sir Caspar Pardon Clarke, the
director of the former institution, at least
favours this theory which I first advanced
in the <cite>New York Herald</cite> in 1905.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE VI.&mdash;POPE JULIUS II.</p>

  <p>(In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence)</p>

<p class="block">Raphael's greatness as a portrait painter may be judged from
his painting of his first papal patron, the warlike Giuliano della
Rovere, who as Pope adopted the name of Julius II. This portrait
has more than the perfection of form, colour, and execution that is
ever associated with Raphael's name. It has depth of character,
dignity, and serious concentration of thought, and is worthy of
being placed beside Velazquez's immortal portrait of Pope Innocent
X. The picture is at the Uffizi Gallery, but replicas are to be
found at the Palazzo Pitti and at the National Gallery.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But to return to Raphael's work in the
Camera della Signatura, the thought and
knowledge and learning displayed in the
whole scheme either prove that the young
master rapidly fell into line with the intellectual
movement of his day, or that he
wisely sought the advice of those who stood
at the head of this movement. Indeed, we
know of a letter in which he asks the poet
Ariosto to advise him about certain details.
Moreover, the Pope himself, no doubt, suggested
his own ideas to his favourite painter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
whilst the cultured Cardinal Bibbiena, Count
Baldassare Castiglione, and the famous
humanist Pietro Bembo, his intimate friends,
were ever at his disposal, and Bramante
probably assisted him in designing the
architectural setting to his groups. Raphael
himself, though extraordinarily receptive, and
better able than anybody else to clothe an
idea in the most perfect pictorial forms,
was not a man of learning. With Dante's
and Petrarch's poetry he must have been
made familiar in his father's house. He
had probably dipped into the writings of
Marsilio Ficino, and also acquired a knowledge
of the rudiments of classic lore; but
that he never mastered the Latin tongue,
which was then a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i> of all
real culture and learning, is clearly evident
from the fact that in the closing years of
his life, when he held the appointment of
inspector of antiquities, he had to enlist the
learned humanist Andrea Fulvio to translate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
for him the Latin inscriptions on classic
ruins.</p>

<p>In the Camera della Signatura, Raphael's
entire decoration has the same sense of
orderly arrangement, the same unity of
conception in the endless variety of <i>motif</i>
and incident, as each individual fresco of
the scheme. On the pendentives, which
connect the ceiling medallions with the
large frescoes on the walls, he painted
the "Fall of Man" next to "Theology,"
the "Judgment of Solomon" next to "Law,"
the "Triumph of Apollo over Marsyas" to
accompany "Poetry," and an allegorical
representation of "Astronomy" (or "Natural
Science") to go with "Philosophy." After
an enormous amount of preparatory work
he proceeded to fill the large wall under
"Theology" with the wonderful monumental
fresco known as the "Disputa del Sacramento,"
which, far from representing a
dispute, shows the confessors and saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and fathers of the Church (and among them
Dante, Savonarola, and Fra Angelico) united
in acknowledging the triumph of the Church
and the miracle of the Eucharist.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall, under "Philosophy,"
is the so-called "School of Athens," in
which, in accordance with the contradictory
spirit of the age, the philosophic systems
of the ancient world are glorified in the
same manner as is Christianity in the
"Disputa." In that nobly-arranged group
of philosophers, Raphael's friends and contemporaries&mdash;Bramante,
Lionardo, Castiglione,
Francesco della Rovere, Federigo
Gonzaga, Sodoma, the artist himself, and
many others&mdash;figure in the guise of Euclid,
Plato, Zoroaster, and other sages. Raphael's
compositional skill was not baffled by the
awkward intrusion of large door-frames into
the space of the remaining two walls, on one
of which, under the Poetry medallion, he depicted
"Parnassus," with the muses and poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
(Homer, Virgil, Dante, Ariosto, Boccaccio,
Tebaldeo, Sappho, &amp;c.) grouped around
Apollo, who plays a viol instead of the
customary lyre. Above the door on the
last wall are allegorical figures of Fortitude,
Prudence, and Temperance, and at the sides
"Justinian delivering the Pandects," and
"Gregory IX." (impersonated by Julius II.)
promulgating the Decretals. The entire
room was finished before November 1511.</p>

<p>It was probably in the same year that
Raphael painted the magnificent portrait
of Julius II. at the Pitti Palace, stern of
feature and careworn, as he well might
have appeared at this time of political
disaster culminating in the loss of Bologna.
But when Raphael set about the decoration
of the "Stanza of Heliodorus," the Pope's
star was again in the ascendant, and his
policy had achieved the signal triumph of
defeating the French and driving them out
of the country. The subjects chosen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the decoration of this room are in consequence
more or less directly connected with
these events, especially the fresco from
which the apartment derives its name: the
"Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple
of Jerusalem"&mdash;an obvious allusion to the
expulsion of the French forces. The fresco
is remarkable for the effective contrast of
the tumultuous dramatic movement on the
right, and the stately repose of the group
on the left, around the majestically enthroned
figure of Pope Julius II.</p>

<p>The same potentate of the Church
appears kneeling opposite the officiating
priest in the fresco of the "Mass of Bolsena,"
which illustrates the miracle of drops
of blood appearing from the Host before the
eyes of the priest who doubts the dogma of
the transubstantiation, an event which has
led to the institution of the Corpus Christi
celebration. The fresco was probably inspired
by Julius himself, who had visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the chapel of Bolsena on his campaign
against Bologna, and perhaps made a vow
on this occasion to commemorate his visit
by a votive offering. This "Mass of Bolsena"
fresco is remarkable for the almost Venetian
glow of warm colour, a result, no doubt, of
the knowledge imparted to Raphael by
Sebastiano del Piombo, who had come to
Rome from Venice in 1511. The wall
opposite illustrates the "Liberation of St.
Peter from Prison," which is, however, not
an allusion, as has been suggested, to Leo
X.'s escape from French captivity, since it
was begun under the régime of Julius II.,
who more probably intended it to signify
the Deliverance of the Church. On the last
wall is depicted the "Retreat of Attila before
St. Leo," with Leo X., who had succeeded
Julius II. in 1513, impersonating his namesake,
but there is little of Raphael's handiwork
in this fresco, the execution of which
is almost entirely due to his assistants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
The decoration of this stanza was completed
in 1514, a year which brought further
honours and duties to Raphael who was
then appointed to succeed Bramante as
architect of St. Peter's.</p>

  <p>PLATE VII.&mdash;PUTTO WITH GARLAND</p>

  <p>(In the Academy of St. Luca, Rome)</p>

<p class="block">The fresco of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">putto</i>, now at the Academy of St. Luca in
Rome, is the only fragment that is left to the world of all the
decorative work executed by Raphael for the corridor leading from
the famous <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</i> of the Vatican to the Belvedere. It probably
belonged to a shield bearing the papal arms, and is a graceful and
characteristic example of the master's treatment of the form of
children which he loved to introduce into his compositions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Henceforth Raphael is to be considered
rather as the head of a little army of
painters and craftsmen, whom he supplied
with ideas and designs to be executed
under his directions, than as a master who
is to be held responsible for the working
out of every detail in the works which were
turned out from his bottega with his sanction,
and under his name. Even in the early
years of his Roman period, comparatively
few of the altar-pieces and easel pictures
commissioned from him were entirely the
work of his brush. In the ever popular
"Madonna della Sedia," at the Pitti Palace,
we have pure Raphael, and also in the
masterpiece known as the "Madonna di
Foligno," which was painted for the Pope's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Chamberlain Sigismondi dei Conti, for his
family chapel in the church of Ara Coeli
in 1512, in commemoration of this dignitary's
escape from a bursting fireball, as is indicated
by the meteor in the landscape background.
This picture was subsequently
removed to Sigismondo's birthplace Foligno,
whence it was carried off by the French
in 1797, but had to be eventually restored,
and is now among the treasures of the
Vatican. The sadly deteriorated "Madonna
of the Tower," at the National Gallery, and
the "Madonna di Casa d'Alba," at the Hermitage,
are probably of the master's own
execution; but Giulio Romano and other
pupils must be held responsible for the
"Vierge au Diadème," the "Madonna del
divino Amore," the "Garvagh Madonna,"
the "Madonna of the Fish," the "Madonna
of the Candelabra," and several other well-known
pictures for which Raphael had
supplied the designs.</p>

<p>A letter written by Raphael to his uncle
Simone Ciarla on the 1st of July 1514 is of
incalculable importance for the light it
throws upon the master's private life and
character. It is written by a man flushed
with success, but modest withal&mdash;in the full
enjoyment of all the gifts that fortune and
his talent and tact have brought to him,
but in no way overbearing or boastful. And
through it all sounds a note of cool calculation&mdash;in
money matters as well as in the
weighing of matrimonial chances. He states
the amount of his fortune, of his salary as
architect of St. Peter's, and of the payments
that are to be made to him for "work in
hand." And in the same way he refers to
an "advantageous match" proposed to him
by Cardinal Bibbiani, to which he has
already pledged himself, but should it fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
to the ground, "I will fall in with your
wishes"&mdash;a reference apparently to an eligible
matrimonial candidate in Urbino. Nor
are there chances lacking in Rome, where,
indeed, he knows of a pretty girl with a
dowry of 3000 gold crowns! He also mentions
with no little pride that he is living
in Rome in his own house.</p>

<p>These remarks about his matrimonial
schemes take us to one of the most interesting
and most disputed chapters of Raphael's
life&mdash;his irregular attachment to the "Bella
Fornarina," the beautiful daughter of a baker
from Siena, which is referred to first by
Vasari, and then, in 1665, by Fabio Chigi,
and has been treated as mere invention by
many modern writers. The evidence collected
by Signor Rodolfo Lanciani proves,
however, the truth of Vasari's story, and
furthermore establishes the name and ultimate
fate of the "Fornarina." According
to local tradition, three houses in Rome are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
pointed out as the successive homes of
Raphael's <i>inamorata</i>; and each of these
houses is in close proximity to the buildings,
on the decoration of which the master was
successively employed. The first of these
houses in the Via di Sta. Dorotea is still
occupied by a bakery known as "il forno
della Fornarina;" the second is in the Vicolo
del Cedro near St. Egidio in Trastevere;
and the third is the Palazzetto Sassi, which
has a tablet let into the wall with an inscription
to the effect that "Tradition says that
the one who became so dear to Raphael,
and whom he raised to fame, lived in this
house."</p>

<p>It has now been ascertained from a
census return made under Leo X. in 1518,
that one of the houses of the Sassi family
was occupied by the baker Francesco from
Siena, which completely tallies with the tradition
that "Margherita, donna di Raffaello,"
as she is described in a contemporary marginal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
note in a copy of the Giunta edition
of Vasari in 1568, was the daughter of a
baker from Siena. But even more decisive
is the proof which was found in 1897 in an
entry in the ledger of the Congregation of
Sant'Apollonia in Trastevere, a kind of
home for fallen and repentant women. This
entry, which is under the date of the 18th
August 1520, that is a little over four months
after Raphael's death, runs as follows: "A
di 18 Augusti 1520 Hoggi e stata recenta nel
<span class="overline">nro</span> Conservatorio ma<sup>a</sup> Margarita vedoa,
figliola del quondam Francescho Luti da
Siena." ("August 18, 1520.&mdash;To-day has
been received into our establishment the
widow <i>Margarita, daughter of the late
Francesco Luti of Siena</i>.") The remarkable
coincidence of dates and names leaves
no doubt that this "widow" was the Bella
Fornarina, Margherita, the daughter of the
baker Francesco from Siena, and the
beautiful creature who served Raphael as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
model for the "Donna Velata," for the
"Sistine Madonna," and for one of the
heads in the "St. Cecilia."</p>

<p>The story goes that Raphael's attachment
lasted up to the time of his death,
when, on the insistence of the Pope's
messenger who was to bring the dying
man the benediction, she was removed from
the room. Vasari also relates that in his
will Raphael "left her a sufficient provision
wherewith she might live in decency."
His long infatuation with the baker's
daughter may well account for his unwillingness
to enter into the bonds of matrimony
even with as desirable and noble
a partner as Cardinal Bernardo Divizio's
niece, Maria Bibbiena, to whom he was
practically engaged in 1514, and who after
years of postponement is said to have died
of a broken heart. Vasari's statement that
Raphael's hesitation was due to the prospect
of a cardinal's hat being bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
upon him is utterly untrustworthy and contrary
to all precedent and reason. It is
much more likely that Raphael considered
it diplomatic to humour a man in as powerful
a position as Cardinal Bibbiena, and to
agree to become engaged to his niece,
even though his own position at the time
was such that he could speak on terms of
equality to cardinals, as may be gathered
from this witty repartee recorded by his
friend Baldassare Castiglione: Two cardinals,
who examined a painting upon which
he was just engaged, found fault with the
redness of the complexion of St. Peter and
St. Paul. "My Lords," retorted Raphael,
"be not concerned; because I painted them
so with full intention, since we have reason
to believe that St. Peter and St. Paul are
as red in Heaven as you see them here,
for shame that their Church should be
governed by such as you!"</p>

<p>But we must return to Raphael's work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
in the last decade of his life. He could
now no longer devote himself entirely to
the art of his choice, and found it utterly
impossible to cope with the multitude of
commissions that were showered upon him
by the mighty of this earth, even though
a swarm of assistants were constantly
kept at work. The vain appeals of Isabella
d'Este for a small painting from his
hand prove the difficulty of obtaining such
a favour. For Raphael was now the
Pope's architect and superintendent of
ceremonies, and in 1515 he was appointed
inspector of antiquities in succession to
Fra Giocondo of Verona. He had to paint
scenery and to design medals and plans;
and on one occasion he was actually
called upon to paint a life-size elephant
on the walls of the Vatican!</p>

  <p>PLATE VIII.&mdash;PORTRAIT OF RAPHAEL</p>

  <p>(In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence)</p>

<p class="block">Though much "restored" and over-painted&mdash;and not by the
most competent hands&mdash;the portrait of Raphael in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sala dei
Pittori</i> at the Uffizi, the Walhalla of pictorial fame, is undoubtedly
painted by the master himself, at the age of about twenty-three,
when his features had lost none of the almost girlish charm and
delicacy of which we are told by contemporary writers. In time
the portrait stands midway between Timoteo Viti's charming drawing
of his "apprentice," the boy Raphael, at the Oxford University
Galleries, and Sebastiano del Piombo's portrait of the "Prince of
Painters" at the Buda-Pesth Museum.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yet, with all these absorbing occupations
he found time to model several reliefs
for the Chigi tomb in the Chigi
Chapel of St. Maria del Popolo, notably
a panel of classic design representing
"Christ and the Woman of Samaria,"
which was cast in bronze by Lorenzotto,
who also executed in marble a statue of
Jonah from a model by Raphael. He
furnished the architectural designs of the
Villa Madama for Giulio dei Medici (afterwards
Clement VII.) and several other
palaces in Rome, and also for the dainty
Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence, where the
alternating arched and triangular pediments
are for the first time introduced
in secular Renaissance architecture. He
furnished the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi
of Bologna with designs like the
famous "Judgment of Paris." He planned
and began an elaborate Cosmography of
Rome; and yet in the midst of all his
varied labours he found leisure to scribble
some ardent love sonnets on his sheets of
drawings. An example of his poetic effusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
is preserved at the British Museum,
and its ardent tone lends colour to Vasari's
assertion that Raphael was extremely
susceptible to the charms of the fair sex.
The palace in which he lived in princely
state was built by Bramante and bought
by Raphael on October 7, 1517. In very
much altered form it still stands in the
Piazza di Scossacavalli at the corner of
the Via di Borgo Nuovo. Since the present
building has been identified as Raphael's
palace, his studio has been discovered, cut
into two apartments, but with a beautiful
wooden ceiling by Bramante left intact.</p>

<p>In this studio he must have painted the
greatest and most deservedly popular of his
altar-pieces, the "Madonna di San Sisto,"
and the "Transfiguration," now at the
Vatican Gallery, which was on his easel
when death stayed his hand. Here, too,
he probably painted that masterly portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of "Baldassare Castiglione," which is one
of the priceless treasures of the Louvre, and
perhaps the magnificent group of "Leo X.
with Cardinals Giulio dei Medici and L.
dei Rossi," now at the Pitti Palace. All the
most notable men who were in Rome at
that period passed through Raphael's studio,
but of the portraits which he is known to
have painted in Rome, comparatively few
have come down to us. That of the
humanist Tommaso Inghirami was until
recently at the Inghirami Palace in Volterra,
but has now gone across the Atlantic; one
of Cardinal Bibbiena is in Madrid; and one
of the Venetian humanists Navagero and
Beazzano in the Doria Palace in Rome.
Among the lost portraits are those of
Pietro Bembo, of Giuliano dei Medici,
Duke of Nemours, of Federigo Gonzaga,
and of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Raphael's pupils had been
busy with the decoration of the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
two <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</i> of the Vatican after Raphael's
designs. In the Stanza dell'Incendio del
Borgo, which was decorated for Leo. X.
between 1514&ndash;1517, Giulio Romano had
painted the "Battle of Ostia" and most of
the "Incendio del Borgo," though parts of
the latter, which illustrates the staying of
the great conflagration by Leo IV.'s prayer,
are unquestionably Raphael's own. The
last room, called the Hall of Constantine,
was almost entirely painted after the
master's death by his pupils, who also had
the chief share in the execution of the
fifty-two scriptural subjects in the Loggia
of the Vatican, which are known as "The
Bible of Raphael." Most of this work was
done by Perino del Vaga, while Giovanni
da Udine added the arabesques and grotesques
round the panels. But all this has
suffered much from exposure to the elements,
and has been entirely repainted.</p>

<p>For Agostino Chigi's Villa Farnesina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Raphael painted the beautiful "Galatea"
fresco, which may be considered the supreme
expression of the spirit of the Renaissance.
This merchant prince gave the master
another opportunity for displaying his decorative
skill, when he employed him in
adorning the Chigi Chapel in St. Maria della
Pace. The Sibyls and Angels of these
frescoes afford the most striking instance
of Michelangelo's influence upon Raphael;
and it is a curious coincidence that it was
just in reference to this work that Michelangelo
was called upon to express his
opinion as to the fairness of Raphael's
charge of 500 ducats. That small jealousy
was not one of Buonarroti's faults appears
from the generous valuation of 900 ducats
he put upon his rival's work.</p>

<p>In 1515&ndash;1516 Raphael designed the cartoons
for the tapestries which were to complete
the decoration of the Sistine Chapel.
The cartoons were translated into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
material by the looms of Flanders at a
cost of 34,000 scudi; and these tapestries
are now, after many wanderings, and after
having suffered much dilapidation, housed
on the upper floor of the Vatican. Seven
of the cartoons, cut into strips for the
exigencies of the loom, were discovered in
Flanders by Rubens, and purchased on his
advice by Charles I. in 1630. On the breaking
up of the ill-fated king's collection,
they were saved from transportation by
Oliver Cromwell and are now at the Victoria
and Albert Museum. The execution of
these cartoons is almost entirely due to
Gian Francesco Penni, and the borders of
the tapestries were designed by Giovanni
da Usline. About 1516 Raphael also decorated
Cardinal Bibbiena's bathroom with
the "Triumphs of Venus and Cupid," in
Pompeian style. The frescoes are still in
existence, but are not accessible to the
public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>In the early days of April 1520 Raphael
was attacked by a fever which he had
probably contracted in superintending some
excavations. He made his last will on the
4th of April and died on the 6th. That he
repented of his treatment of Maria Bibbiena
is fairly evident from the epitaph which, by
his wish, was placed upon her tomb: "We,
Baldassare Turini da Pescia and Gianbattista
Branconi dall'Aquila, testamentary executors
and recipients of the last wishes of Raphael,
have raised this memorial to his affianced
wife, Maria, daughter of Antonio da Bibbiena,
whom death deprived of a happy marriage."
After providing for the Fornarina, so that
she might "live in decency," he left his fortune
of 16,000 ducats to his relatives, and his
drawings and sketches to his favourite
pupils Giulio Romano and Penni. He was
buried in the Pantheon in close proximity
to Maria Bibbiena. His epitaph was written
by Cardinal Bembo, and Count Baldassare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Castiglione also put his grief into the shape
of a beautiful sonnet.</p>

<p>"The death of Raphael," says Vasari,
"was bitterly deplored by all the Papal
court, not only because he had formed part
thereof, since he had held the office of
chamberlain to the Pontiff, but also because
Leo X. had esteemed him so highly, that
his loss occasioned that sovereign the
bitterest grief. Oh, most happy and thrice
blessed spirit, of whom all are proud to
speak, whose actions are celebrated with
praise by all men, and the least of whose
works left behind thee is admired and
prized."</p>
